=================================================

In this tutorial, I guide you through setting up your own local ownCloud server and discuss the application API. We will explore the App Framework modules by creating and enabling an app based on the Advanced App Template.

For more information about ownCloud in general, please see `<http://owncloud.org/about/>`_.
